# Node.js Attributes Based Access Control library

This library is designed to help implement the concept of Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) in your Node.js applications 
using simple `JSON` policies.

For more information on ABAC consider reading the [NIST Specification Guide](http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/specialpublications/NIST.sp.800-162.pdf).
